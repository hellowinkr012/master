# Data Definition

    Atomic − Definition should define a single concept.
    Traceable − Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
    Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.
    Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable.

# Data Object - Data Object represents an object having a data.


# Data Type

    Built-in Data Type -int,str,bool,float

    Derived Data Type-list,dict,stack,queue

# Basic Operations

    Traversing
    Searching
    Insertion
    Deletion
    Sorting
    Merging

# General Data Structures

    Liner Data Structures

        Array: sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the data element.

        Linked List: Each data element contains a link to another element along with the data present in it.

        Stack: LIFO(last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out).

        Queue: only FIFO(First In First Out).

        Matrix: It is two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices.
    
    Non-Liner Data Structures - no sequential linking of data elements
        
        Binary Tree: Ieach data element can be connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node.

        Heap: It is a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes or strictly less than it’s child nodes.
        
        Hash Table: It is a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather than index from a data element.
        
        Graph: .It is an arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.


# list comrehension

# stack - FILO , LIFO

    empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty 
    size() – Returns the size of the stack
    top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack 
    push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack 
    pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack

# queue - FIFO only

    Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition
    Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition –
    Front: Get the front item from queue 
    Rear: Get the last item from queue
