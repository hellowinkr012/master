# major component of RDBMS

    1. Table
    2. Record or Tuple
    3. Field or Column name or Attribute
    4. Domain - permitted value for a column
    5. Instance
    6. Schema - design of database (physical/logical/view)
    7. Keys 

# keys 


    Primary Key – A primary is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies tuples (rows) in that table.

    Super Key – A super key is a set of one of more columns (attributes) to uniquely identify rows in a table.

    Candidate Key – A super key with no redundant attribute is known as candidate key

    Alternate Key – Out of all candidate keys, only one gets selected as primary key, remaining keys are known as alternate or secondary keys.

    Composite Key – A key that consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify rows (also known as records & tuples) in a table is called composite key.

    Foreign Key – Foreign keys are the columns of a table that points to the primary key of another table. They act as a cross-reference between tables.
